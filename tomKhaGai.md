Delicious coconut soup that can be made a bit spicy. 

Translates to "boiled galangal chicken," as it uses galangal (aka Thai ginger) rather than ginger root. Ginger can be substituted in a pinch with bay leaves and pepper. 

### Ingredients

Listed in order of use

- 1 T. coconut oil
- 1 T. Thai red chili paste
- 0.5 t. Japanese red chili flakes
- 1 lb. chicken breast or thigh (preferrably the latter)
- 4 cups chicken stock (or better than bullion)
- 3 to 5 cloves of garlic
- 2 inch piece galangal
    - If no galangal:
        - 2 in. ginger
        - 3 bay leaves
        - 0.5 t. pepper
- 1 t. salt
- 2 stalks lemongrass
- 1 can coconut milk
    - don't skimp here
- 2 T. Thai fish sauce
- 2 T. brown sugar
    - or coconut sugar if you can get it
- 4 T. lime juice
    - or Kaffir lime leaves if you can get it
- 8 oz. shitake mushrooms

### Prep

1. Cut lemon grass into thirds, remove outer skin
1. Mince garlic or run through press
1. Cut chicken into inch cubes
1. Add lime juice, brown sugar, and fish sauce to small saucer

### Cook

1. In large enough pot, heat coconut oil over medium high heat. Add chili paste and flakes and cook quickly
1. Add chicken till opqaue but not cooked through
1. Add chicken stock, galangal (or replacement), lemongrass, basil, salt and pepper. Bring to boil, then let simmer 10 minutes. 
1. Add coconut milk, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and let simmer for at least a few minutes.

### Notes

- Thai red curry paste is the secret weapon here, but I have subsituted it with gokujang chili paste before. 
- Use galangal if you can get it. These days they sell it at Wegmans. Also sold as `Thai ginger`. 
- Kaffir lime leaves can be substituted with lime juice with no issues, IMO. 
- Fish sauce is critical, do not omit
- Can go up to 4x the coconut milk for creamier soup
- Use sriracha to flavor/spice after served in a bowl
